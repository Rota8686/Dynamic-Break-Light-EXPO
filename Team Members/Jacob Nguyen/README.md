## Jacob Nguyen

Jacob Nguyen was a core part of the Dynamic Brake Light team.  Jacob put substantial time and effort into designing the housing for the LED module, developing his soldering skills and diligently preparing useful technical documents and presentation materials.  

Jacob's most significant contribution to the Dynamic Brake Light was his LED module housing.  Going into the project with little CAD experience, Jacob developed a great command over the SolidWorks tools, using them to design an well-thought-out housing.  Jacob balanced visual appeal with clearly identifiable brake and turn signal lights.  To this end, Jacob worked closely with Mitchell Vallis and Rowan McCune to add turn signal cutouts and integrate parts from a commercially available bike light into the LED module housing.

Jacob learned how to operate the laser cutters in the ITLL, where he designed and cut acrylic that held a snug tolerance with the cutouts on the housing.  

During the assembly of the demo version of the Dynamic Brake Light, Jacob dealt with the difficult task of soldering within a compact casing.  From this experience, Jacob greatly improved his soldering technique, as evident by this clean cable management and solid solder joints.
