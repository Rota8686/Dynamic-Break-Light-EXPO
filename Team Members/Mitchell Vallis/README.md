# Mitchell Vallis

Mitchell Vallis was a critical part of the Dynamic Brake Light Team.  Mitchell's primary contributions include envisioning the idea of a dynamic brake light, coding the LED module's mirco controller, designing and assembling the LED module's ciruit board, and creating high quality technical documents and presentation materials.  Mitchell also help with designing a compact housing for the LED module and integrating the LED and display systems

During the developement of the Dynamic Brake Light, Mitchell was faced with faulty electrical components, intricate coding challenges, and demanding spacial constraints within the LED module housing.  While successfully solving these problems, Mitchell learned proper soldering techniques and developed code to filter and interpret accelerometer readings with the purpose of dynamically controlling LED arrays.

Mitchell's cheif accomplishment was writing the code for the accelerometer circuit.  This code turned raw accelerometer voltage readings into dynamically LED cotrolled arrays using medium pass filters and PWM gradients.

In conjuction with Jacob Nguyen, Mitchell constructed a LED module housing that maintained a low profile while containing a circuit board and three separate LED arrays.  Mitchell worked with Roman Tagliola to establish wireless communication between the LED and display modules using a two-way ESP-NOW wifi channel.  This wireless communication transmitted accelerometer readings from the LED module to the display and turn signal inputs from the display to the LED module.
